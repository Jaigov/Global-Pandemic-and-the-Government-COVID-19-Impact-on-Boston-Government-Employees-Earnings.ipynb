Project Introduction & Objective: Our goal is to evaluate the Boston government sector to understand the impact of the global pandemic, COVID-19, on the employees’ earnings for public sector. The main topics that we will focus on covering are the followings:

Pandemic Impact Analysis: Examine data across the years before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic to assess its effects on earnings and workforce dynamics in the public sector. This includes changes in employment numbers, salary adjustments, and variations in overtime or bonus distributions.

Earnings and Position Analysis: Investigate which job levels or positions recorded the highest earnings and determine which department saw the highest fluctuation in employee numbers during the pandemic. This analysis will help identify the roles and departments most impacted by the pandemic.

Income Component Assessment: Analyze various components of employee income (such as base pay, overtime, bonuses, etc.) to determine which has the most significant impact on an employee’s gross earnings, especially during the pandemic period.

Geographic Pattern Analysis: Construct and analyze patterns from data collected across various Boston areas/zip codes to understand if the pandemic’s impact on earnings varied geographically within Boston Area.

Motivation: Understanding the Boston Government's resource allocation is crucial for businesses and professionals, influencing economic development and fostering collaboration between the private and public sectors. The COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in 2020, profoundly changed people’s lives and economies globally, resulting in many job losses and a transition to remote learning. In the meantime, industries continue to face a slow rebound. We aim to delve into the public sector within the Boston area to identify any significant change in employment structure, offering crucial insights for those eyeing careers in public sector after graduation.

We will also analyze the public sector’s reaction to the pandemic, offering a critical perspective on the resilience of government employment reacting to global economic challenges. The intertwined relationship between public sector performance, consumer spending, and economic growth is also explored, offering businesses insights to tailor products and services specific for the public sector. In conclusion, our comprehensive analysis goes beyond the implications of the pandemic and provides valuable information for companies and individuals whose economic activity is engaged in Boston's government sector.

Data Source: For the developement of this project we have used two datasets from two different sources.

Boston Government - Office of Human Resources: https://data.boston.gov/dataset/employee-earnings-report
The City of Boston releases an annual dataset containing payroll information for its employees, encompassing employee names, job details, and earnings breakdown, including base salary, overtime, and total compensation. To conduct a comprehensive analysis, we are using the dataset spanning the years 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, and 2022. This resource, offers citizens valuable insights into the financial aspects of the City's workforce during these specific years.

United States Zip Codes - Massachusetts: https://www.unitedstateszipcodes.org/ma/
This dataset provides zip code information for Massachusetts, including key details such as zip code, type, primary city, state, county, timezone, latitude, longitude among others. It offers a concise and comprehensive snapshot of geographic and locational attributes associated with each zip code in the state of Massachusetts. By incorporating this dataset, the project can be analyzed in a location-wise level.

Report Summary: This project conducts an in-depth analysis of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on earnings within the Boston government sector, leveraging extensive datasets spanning data sourced from Boston Government’s payroll records for years 2018 to 2022 and Massachusetts zip code information. Specifically focusing on the pre-pandemic, pandemic, and post-pandemic periods, the project aims to uncover key trends and dynamics in the workforce, with a focus on objectives such as identifying top-earning job titles, evaluating departments with the highest employee numbers, and scrutinizing income components influencing gross earnings.

In terms of our payroll analysis results, we observed remarkable resilience and adaptability within the government job market over the last five years, showcasing the sector's rapid recovery post-COVID. Addressing the main objectives, our findings revealed anticipated yet noteworthy outcomes. Firstly, roles such as Police Officers, Fire Fighters, and Police Detectives emerged as top earners. Furthermore, the Boston Police Department dominated job offerings, constituting approximately 14% of all government jobs in Boston. Finally, our examination highlighted that regular and overtime income constitute the primary components of annual earnings for the Boston Police Department, accounting for 58% and 19%, respectively.

Conclusion:
The job market within the Boston Government sector demonstrated adaptability in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. There was a slight shift observed but nothing significant. The Boston Government sector underwent a gradual reduction in jobs from 2018 to 2022, with Suffolk County consistently serving as the primary employment hub. A peak in job count occurred in 2018, followed by a decline in subsequent years, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. While there was a partial recovery in 2021 and 2022, job levels did not reach pre-pandemic peaks. Suffolk County maintained its position, with a relatively steady ratio (67-68%) of the highest to total jobs, although showing a slight decrease post-COVID. Notably, Suffolk County experienced the most substantial worker layoffs from 2018 to 2020, followed by a remarkable post-pandemic rebound in hiring between 2020 and 2022.

Boston Government sector earnings data demonstrates its diverse pay structures, with the Police Department showing significant disparities in earnings, and the Fire Department displaying higher median earnings. This variability across departments highlights the impact of unique role demands, such as the specialized skills or increased risk factors associated, and various compensation policies in alignment with job responsibilities.

We observed a slight dip in the number of jobs from 22,901 in 2018 to 21,406 in 2020. However, the job market quickly recovered, with the number of jobs increasing to 22,153 in 2022, which shows that the Boston government jobs are stable especially when compared to corporate sector jobs

Despite the global pandemic occurring in 2020, the median salary remained stable at USD 79,000 in 2021, and there was a subsequent increase to USD 80,000 in 2022.This suggests a level of resilience in the government job market and possibly effective measures taken to mitigate the economic impact of the pandemic. The city took efforts to adjust its budget in response to the pandemic, including hiring freezes and non-essential spending reductions. It was also supported by federal relief funds to support essential services and avoid layoffs. The city's expansion of telework policies, allowing many government employees to work remotely during the pandemic.

We also see that out of the 14 counties the most employees are from Suffolk county, Middlesex and then Norfolk county this can be explained because these three counties have significantly higher population densities compared to other surrounding areas. A higher population provides a larger pool of potential employees for Boston businesses, increasing the likelihood of finding qualified candidates within these counties.

In the analysis of workforce changes from 2018 to 2020, several job titles experienced significant layoffs, reflecting shifts in employment trends. Notably, Teachers and Substitutes Teaches emerged as the roles with the most substantial worker layoffs, both witnessing a decrease of 406 workers each. Following closely, Part-Time Custodian faced a notable reduction of 105 workers, while Lunch Hour Monitors and Lifeguard I experienced decreases of 74 and 71 workers, respectively. In the analysis of workforce changes from 2020 to 2022, notable shifts in employment trends are evident across various job titles. Teachers once again played a significant role in this period, experiencing substantial growth with an increase of 224 workers. Paraprofessionals also saw a notable rise, securing the second position with a workforce expansion of 170 individuals. Then, Cab Monitor follows closely, demonstrating an increase of 139 workers, while Social Worker/Coordinator and Instructional Coach experienced growth with 99 and 95 additional workers, respectively.

In conclusion, the Boston Government sector displayed resilience and adaptability during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a gradual recovery in job levels post-2020. The stable median salary and varied pay structures across departments is notable of the sector's diverse employment landscape.


Challenges:
Our biggest challenges was with the CSV files in the datasets. We were unable to upload the original files to BigQuery initially since there were commas in the numerical fields in the CSV files, so it took time to research the issue and find the right solution to make the files run in BigQuery. We changed the CSV file format to semicolon delimited format, and set up the BigQuery to read this specific file format. The initial cleaning and uploading process took us over 4 hours.

Another challenge was the lack of knowledge about the sector. All of us are international students and have little to no knowledge about the public sector in the US, so we had to research and understand the minute detailings about the functioning so we can address the problem at hand better. Throughout the life-cycle of the project, we were constantly reading articles and news to understand how the US public sector and specifically, Boston public sector functioned in certain global/economic situations. This research helped us understand the metrics of the dataset and how to work with them as well
